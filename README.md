# User Authentication Project

This project is a simple **user authentication system** built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. It includes features such as user registration, login, password encryption, and JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. The application is structured as a microservice that can be easily integrated with other applications.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to register with email and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users with email and password.
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords are securely stored using bcrypt encryption.
- **JWT Authentication**: Issues JWT tokens to authenticate users for accessing protected routes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Use a local MongoDB server or sign up for [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for cloud-based database management.

## Installation
